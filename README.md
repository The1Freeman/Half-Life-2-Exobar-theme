# Half-Life 2 Exobar theme
Statusbar theme for Exobar, a jailbreak tweak made by Nepeta, making it look like the HUD found in Half-Life 2 and its Episodes (also includes shittly written HTML and CSS code!)

This is making use of variables found within Exobar (https://docs.nepeta.me/exo/variables), so don't try to run it in your browser (unless you want to, of course, I'm not here to stop you).

To install, SSH into your iPhone, and drop the "Half-Life 2" folder inside /Library/Exobar, that's all.

possible to-do's:

 - [x] ~~adjust font so that AM and PM are visible~~
 - [ ] learn enough JS to enable a glowing effect on the numbers the same way HL2 does
 - [ ] theme variations?
 - [ ] enable some cool shit like tapping on the statusbar to get some various information about other things
