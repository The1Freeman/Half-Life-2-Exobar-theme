# Half-Life 2 Exobar theme
Statusbar theme for Exobar, a jailbreak tweak made by [Nepeta](https://twitter.com/NepetaDev), making it look like the HUD found in [Half-Life 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/) and its Episodes.

This is making use of [variables](https://docs.nepeta.me/exo/variables) found within Exobar, so don't try to run it in your browser (unless you want to, of course, I'm not here to stop you), testing however is recommended on a jailbroken iPhone with Exobar installed.

To install, SSH into your jailbroken iPhone, and drop the "Half-Life 2" folder inside /Library/Exobar, that's all.

possible to-do's:

 - [x] ~~adjust font so that AM and PM are visible~~
 - [ ] learn enough JS to enable a glowing effect on the numbers the same way HL2 does
 - [ ] theme variations?
 - [ ] enable some cool shit like tapping on the statusbar to get some various information about other things
