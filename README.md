# Half-Life 2 Exobar theme
Statusbar theme for Exobar, a jailbreak tweak made by [Nepeta](https://twitter.com/NepetaDev), making it look like the HUD found in [Half-Life 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/) and its Episodes.

This is currently making use of the strength of your mobile signal, which is displayed as your "health bar".
It also displays your phone battery as your HEV suit power, once Exobar exposes more information about the device that could otherwise become useful, there will be variations made out of this theme.

This is making use of [variables](https://docs.nepeta.me/exo/variables) found within Exobar, so don't try to run it in your browser (unless you want to, of course, I'm not here to stop you), testing however is recommended on a jailbroken iPhone with Exobar installed.

To install, SSH into your jailbroken iPhone, and drop the "Half-Life 2" folder inside /Library/Exobar, that's all.

possible to-do's:

 - [x] ~~adjust font so that AM and PM are visible~~
 - [ ] learn enough JS to enable a glowing effect on the numbers the same way HL2 does
 - [ ] theme variations? (think about this when exobar exposes more device info)
 - [ ] enable some cool shit like tapping on the statusbar to get some various information about other things
